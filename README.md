## Hello, my name is Nathan Debebe. I am a website developer. Today in our lesson, we learned mainly about 'Text, Calculator, and Storage'
What is Text?
	Let's say we have two book publishers even though they have different styles they have the same structure. The structure is the title, content, and main text. So let us translate this programming language, they all have the same functionalities even though they have their own rules and regulations.
What is Calculator? How did they come?
	Let's try to explain these with an old story. the Manhattan Project. It happened between 1942 - 1946 G.C. The Manhattan Project produced the first atomic bomb. Several lines of analysis were pursued simultaneously. Hundreds of scientists gathered around to do this project. The man who has the responsibility to do the calculations has only one calculator that adds, substracts, and multiplies a lot of numbers at once. Since the calculations are a lot so he gathered some girls around the town because of the lockdown he gave them to calculate numbers. Those girls used to compute the numbers so he called them computers. Soon he thought "why won't we invent the machine that calculates and uses the four operators?" They were invented and they were called computers.
What is storage?
	Storage is the action or method to store a specific material for future use. It's preferred to cache those materials in a place where you can keep them safe or don't disappear when the company shut's down.
